## PLEASE REACH OUT TO PRANAV IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
- Each folder is a single project
- There should in theory be only one person using each folder at a single time
- Before starting always git pull
- Before pushing, always git pull
- Since each person is working with a different set of files, if you run into an issue while pulling, you can git stash, git pull, then git stash pop
- Do NOT add any metadata, DS_Store files (these should already be added in the gitignore)

## STM Projects
- Open in CubeIDE
- Core/Src/main.c should have most of your info
- [PROJECT].ioc should have your pinout information (if you open in CubeIDE, it should give you a nice UI)

## How to use TEMPLATE
- git pull
- duplicate TEMPLATE in finder (DO NOT RENAME YET)
- Open project in CubeIDE
- Right click project in CubeIDE and rename to project name (ig. APPS, STEERING_WHEEL, ... ALL CAPS please)
- After the project has been renamed in CubeIDE, you can rename the TEMPLATE Folder in your finder to the project name

## Future improvements since this was super quick
- Branches for projects and merge
